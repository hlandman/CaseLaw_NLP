Extractive and Abstractive Methods for Case Law Summarization

The scope of this project is to produce automated summarization of Case Law by utilizing extractive or abstractive NLP models. Case law is a collection of legal decisions that are used in future cases to determine legal precedents. 

The <a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a> files compiled by Harvard Law School is a corpus of three hundered years worth of Case Law documentation in the United States. For this project North Carolina Case Law files were used as source data.
